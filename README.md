## JavaScript Password Generator

This is a randow password generator built using JavaScript. It contains prompts asking the user what type of characters they would prefer. An event listener is used for the generate button as well as a for loop read/write the length of the password.
Through this project I learnt more about the use of for loops and ahow they work. I also learnt about the use of confirm for boonlean input & more on 'if' statments/conditions.
